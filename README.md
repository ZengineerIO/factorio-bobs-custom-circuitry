# Customizable Circuitry for Bob's

*Summary: Customize circuit network component recipes and tech for Bob's Electronics mod. For early circuitry or even hardcore endgame combinators.*

Customize recipes and tech for circuit network components (wires & combinators [incl. speaker & power switch]) with [Bob's Electronics mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobelectronics). Can be used for early circuitry or even for hardcore endgame combinators, because why wouldn't you.

Available startup settings:

- Cable and circuit type for wire recipes can be selected. (Default option will be used in recipes if an unavailable component has been chosen)
- A new setting to align the other logic components recipes with the wires recipes. (The old 'Cheaper combinators' setting will be overridden by this and will be removed in the future)
- A new setting to adjust the technology for circuit network:
  - attempts to incorporate the cable and circuit selection into the prerequisites and tech cost.
  - Probably best used with Angel's mods.
  - SeaBlock/ScienceCostTweakerMod compatible.
  - Examples:
    - when used with copper cable or basic circuit board, the tech will have logistic science pack removed and some prerequisites changed.
    - silver cable adds silver smelting as prerequisite and chemical science pack to the tech. Same goes for the circuits.
    - without SeaBlock installed, rubber and insulated cable unlocks will be spread across wood processing 1 and electronics.
    - with ScienceCostTwearkerMod/SeaBlock(Pack) installed, the circuit will be limited to processing-unit to a void an evil loop and leave SCTM as is.

For bugs and suggestions, [GitHub](https://github.com/ZengineerIO/factorio-bobs-custom-circuitry/issues) is probably the best place to go.
