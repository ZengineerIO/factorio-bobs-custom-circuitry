# Customizable Circuitry for Bob's

*Summary: Cutomize logic components cost for Bob's Electronics mod. For early circuitry or even hardcore endgame combinators.*

Customize the cost for logic components (wires & combinators [incl. speaker & power switch]) with [Bob's Electronics mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobelectronics). Can be used for early circuitry or even for hardcore endgame combinators.

Available startup settings:

- Cable and circuit type for wire recipes can be selected.
- A new setting to align the other logic components recipe with the wires. (The old 'Cheaper combinators' setting will be overridden by this and will be removed in the future)
- A new setting to adjust the technology for circuit network:
  - attempts to incorporate the cable and circuit selection into the prerequisites and tech cost.
  - Probably best used with Angel's mods.
  - SeaBlock compatible.
  - Examples:
    - when used with copper-cable or basic-circuit-board, the tech will have logistic-science-pack removed and some prerequisites changed.
    - gilded-copper-cable adds gold smelting as prerequisite and chemical science pack to the tech. Same goes for the circuits.
    - without SeaBlock installed, rubber and insulated-cable will be unlocked with the otherwise empty rubber technology.

For Bugs and suggestions, [GitHub](https://github.com/ZengineerIO/factorio-bobs-custom-circuitry/issues) is probably the best place to go.
